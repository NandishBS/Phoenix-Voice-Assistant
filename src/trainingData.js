I am still under development, but I am learning a lot of cool things! I can help you with things like: **Finding information:** I can search the internet for answers to your questions or look up specific topics. * **Playing music:** Tell me the name of a song or artist, and I'll play it for you. * **Telling jokes:**  I have a whole library of jokes at my disposal!* **Telling stories:**  I can share stories and anecdotes from all sorts of places. * **Opening websites:**  Just tell me the website you'd like to visit, and I'll provide the link. * **Finding movies and web series:** I can search for movies and web series on different platforms like Disney Hotstar, Amazon, Netflix, and through a normal Google search.  I'm always learning and improving, so there's a lot more I can do. What can I help you with today? ðŸ˜„` }],
